# Error Handling & Best Practices

## Q: How do you define custom error types in Go?
To define custom error types, create a struct and implement the Error method:
```go
type MyError struct {
    Msg string
}

func (e MyError) Error() string {
    return e.Msg
}

func example() error {
    return MyError{Msg: "An error occurred"}
}

```

## Q: How do you wrap errors in Go?
Use the %w verb with fmt.Errorf to wrap an error with additional context:
```go
if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to do something: %w", err)
}
```

## Q: How do you handle errors in Go?
In Go, errors are typically handled by checking the returned error value:
```go
if err := someFunction(); err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)
}
```

# Go Memory Management

## Q: How does garbage collection work in Go?
Go uses garbage collection (GC) to automatically manage memory by reclaiming unused memory. The GC runs in the background and is concurrent with program execution.

## Q: What is the difference between a pointer and a value in Go?
A value is the actual data, whereas a pointer holds the memory address of a value:
```go
x := 10
p := &x  // p is a pointer to x
fmt.Println(*p)  // Dereferencing the pointer to get the value
```

## Q: How do you allocate memory for slices and maps in Go?
You use make to allocate memory for slices and maps:
```go
slice := make([]int, 0, 10)  // slice with length 0 and capacity 10
m := make(map[string]int)    // map with string keys and int values
```

# Go Performance and Optimization

## Q: How do you measure execution time in Go?
```go
start := time.Now()
doWork()
fmt.Println("Execution time:", time.Since(start))
```

## Q: How do you handle concurrency issues in Go?
Concurrency issues, such as race conditions, are often handled by:
1. Using sync.Mutex for locking shared resources.
2. Using sync.WaitGroup to wait for goroutines to finish.
3. Avoiding shared state by using channels to communicate between goroutines.

## Q: How do you optimize performance in Go?
You can optimize performance in Go by:
1. Using efficient data structures like map and slice.
2. Avoiding unnecessary allocations.
3. Using sync.Pool for reusing objects.
4. Minimizing locks and using fine-grained concurrency.

# Miscellaneous

## Q: How do you format code in Go?
Use the built-in gofmt tool to automatically format your Go code:
```bash
gofmt -w yourfile.go
```

## Q: How do you run tests in Go?

```bash
go test
```

## Q: How do you implement a queue in Go?
A simple queue can be implemented using a slice:
```go
type Queue []int

func (q *Queue) Enqueue(val int) {
    *q = append(*q, val)
}

func (q *Queue) Dequeue() int {
    val := (*q)[0]
    *q = (*q)[1:]
    return val
}
```

# Go Language Features

## Q: How do you define and use constants in Go?
You define constants using the const keyword:
```go
const Pi = 3.14159
const Hello = "Hello, world!"
```

## Q: How do you create and use a struct in Go?
A struct is a composite data type that groups together variables of different types:
```go
type Person struct {
    Name  string
    Age   int
}

p := Person{Name: "John", Age: 30}
fmt.Println(p.Name) // Output: John
```

## Q: What is the init() function in Go?
The init() function is executed automatically before main() and is typically used for initialization tasks, like setting up variables or establishing connections:
```go
func init() {
    fmt.Println("Initialization tasks")
}
```

## Q: What are Go's built-in data types?
Go has a variety of built-in data types, including:
- Numeric types: int, float32, float64, etc.
- Boolean: bool
- String: string
- Composite types: array, slice, map, struct, channel
- Pointer: *T (a pointer to type T)

## Q: How do you use the defer statement in Go?
The defer statement schedules a function to be executed once the surrounding function returns. It's commonly used for cleanup tasks:
```go
defer fmt.Println("This will run last")
fmt.Println("This will run first")
```

# Go Concurrency

## Q: What is a goroutine scheduler?
The Go runtime scheduler manages the execution of goroutines, multiplexing them onto available threads. It schedules goroutines based on availability and workload.

## Q: How do you handle panics in goroutines?
You can recover from panics in a goroutine by using defer and recover:
```go
go func() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
        }
    }()
    // code that might panic
}()
```

## Q: What is the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels?
- Buffered channels have a capacity and allow sending/receiving values without blocking until the buffer is full/empty.
- Unbuffered channels block the sender and receiver until the other side is ready.

## Q: How do you synchronize goroutines?
You can synchronize goroutines using:
1. sync.WaitGroup for waiting until all goroutines complete.
2. sync.Mutex for locking shared resources.
3. sync.Cond for signaling between goroutines.

## Q: How do you manage goroutine lifecycle?
You can manage the lifecycle by controlling when they start, wait for completion, and signal termination using channels or a sync.WaitGroup.

## Q: What is a goroutine?
A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. You start one by prefixing a function call with `go`:
```go
go doWork()
```

## Q: What is a channel?
A channel is a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator `<-`:
```go
ch := make(chan int)
go func() {
    ch <- 5  // send 5 to the channel
}()
value := <-ch  // receive from channel
```

## Q: How do you use `select` with channels?
`select` lets you wait on multiple channel operations:
```go
select {
case v := <-ch1:
    fmt.Println("received", v, "from ch1")
case ch2 <- 3:
    fmt.Println("sent 3 to ch2")
default:
    fmt.Println("no communication")
}
```

## Q: What are buffered channels?
Buffered channels have a capacity and donâ€™t block until full:
```go
ch := make(chan int, 2)
ch <- 1
ch <- 2
```

## Q: How do you aggregate errors from concurrent tasks?
Use a mutex and slice to collect errors safely across goroutines:
```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup
var mu sync.Mutex
var errors []error

for _, task := range tasks {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(t Task) {
        defer wg.Done()
        if err := t.Execute(); err != nil {
            mu.Lock()
            errors = append(errors, err)
            mu.Unlock()
        }
    }(task)
}
wg.Wait()

if len(errors) > 0 {
    // Handle aggregate errors
}
```

## Q: How do you handle cancellation and timeouts in goroutines?
Use the `context.Context` package for propagating cancelation signals:
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
defer cancel()

// Use ctx in a goroutine
go func(ctx context.Context) {
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Operation timed out")
    case result := <-performLongOperation(ctx):
        fmt.Println("Result:", result)
    }
}(ctx)
```

## Q: How do you implement graceful shutdown?
Use a signal handler to catch termination signals and shut down your server cleanly:
```go
func shutdownServer(s *http.Server) {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    if err := s.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Server forced to shutdown:", err)
    }
}

// Signal handling for graceful shutdown
c := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt)

go func() {
    <-c
    shutdownServer(s)
}()
```

# Go Language Features

}

for _, tc := range tests {
    t.Run(fmt.Sprintf("input: %d", tc.input), func(t *testing.T) {
        got := double(tc.input)
        if got != tc.want {
            t.Errorf("got %d, want %d", got, tc.want)
        }
    })
}
```

    return func(s *Server) { s.port = port }
}

func NewServer(opts ...Option) *Server {
    s := &Server{port: 8080}
    for _, opt := range opts {
        opt(s)
    }
    return s
}
```

close(ch)
```

## Q: How do you manage long-running goroutines?
Use a `done` channel to stop them:
```go
done := make(chan struct{})
go func() {
    for {
        select {
        case <-done:
            return

## Q: What are some key features of the Go programming language?
Go is designed for system programming and emphasizes simplicity and efficiency. Key features include:
- Static Typing: Strong and explicit variable types that improve error detection at compile time.
- Garbage Collection: Automatic memory management that helps prevent memory leaks.
- Concurrency: Built-in support for concurrent programming with go-routines and channels.

## Q: What are the principles of writing effective Go code?
Key principles include:
- Naming Conventions
    - Choose clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and types.
    - Use mixedCaps or CamelCase for multi-word names.
    - Avoid acronyms unless they are widely known.
    - Start files with the name of the package they belong to.
- Error Handling
    - Go does not have exceptions. Error handling is managed by returning error values.
    ```go 
    result, err := someOperation()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    ```
    - Consider wrapping errors with additional context using fmt.Errorf.
    ```go
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to process data: %w", err)
    ```
- Code Formatting
    - Consistently format code using gofmt, which is included in every Go installation.
- Control Structures
    - Use if, for, and switch as your primary control flow mechanisms. Go does not have a while statement; use for with conditions instead.
    ```go
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
    ```
- Defer, Panic, and Recover
    - defer statements are executed after the function returns:
    ```go 
    defer fmt.Println("World")
    fmt.Println("Hello")
    ```
    - Use panic for unrecoverable errors and recover to regain control in deferred functions.

type Config struct {
    Port        int
    DatabaseURL string
}

func LoadConfig() Config {
    return Config{Port: 8080, DatabaseURL: "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/mydb"}
}
```

## Q: What is graceful shutdown in Go?
Implement graceful shutdown for applications to allow in-progress requests to complete:
```go
func shutdownServer(s *http.Server) {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    if err := s.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Server forced to shutdown:", err)
    }
}

// Signal handling for graceful shutdown
c
```

## Q: How can you implement signal handling for graceful shutdown?
You can implement signal handling for graceful shutdown like this:
```go
c := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt)

go func() {
    <-c
    shutdownServer(s)
}()
```

## Q: What are common idioms in Go programming?
Go programming has several idioms that developers use to improve clarity and maintainability.

## How do you define and use variadic functions?
Variadic functions allow handling a variable number of parameters:
```go
func Sum(numbers ...int) int {
    total := 0
    for _, n := range numbers {
        total += n
    }
    return total
}

// Call with any number of arguments
result := Sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
fmt.Println("Total:", result) // Output: Total: 15
```

## Q: How do you create slices and maps in Go?
- Creating a slice:
```go
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3} // Slice of integers
```
- Creating a map:
```go
ages := map[string]int{
    "Alice": 30,
    "Bob":   25,
}
```

## Q: How is string formatting handled in Go?
Go provides a robust way to format strings:
```go 
msg := fmt.Sprintf("User %s has %d points.", username, points)
```

## Q: What is the blank identifier used for in Go?
You can use the blank identifier when you want to ignore one of the returned values:
```go
_, err := someFunction() // Ignore the first return value
```

## Q: How do you handle errors early in Go?
A common pattern in Go is to return quickly on error checks:
```go
if err != nil {
    return err // Early return on error
}
```

## Q: How do you check for errors idiomatically in Go?
Check for errors immediately after a function call in this way:
```go
if err != nil {
    return err // Handle the error immediately
}
```

## Q: How do you synchronize goroutines with WaitGroups?
The sync.WaitGroup allows you to wait for a group of goroutines to finish executing:
```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(1)
go func() {
    defer wg.Done()
    // Perform work
}()
wg.Wait() // Wait until all goroutines have completed
```

## Q: What is the purpose of init functions in Go?
init functions are executed before the main function, allowing for package-level initialization.

## Q: What are zero values in Go?
All Go types have a default zero value:
- Numeric types: 0
- Booleans: false
- Strings: ""
- Pointers: nil

## Q: How can you defer cleanup actions in Go?
Use defer for clean-up actions to ensure resources are freed properly:
```go 
file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer file.Close() // Ensures that the file is closed when the function exits
```

## Q: How is resource management handled in Go?
Proper resource management in Go is vital for writing efficient and bug-free applications.

## Q: How do you manage goroutines effectively?
Ensure goroutines terminate when they are no longer needed. Use channels to signal when to stop:
```go
done := make(chan struct{})
go func() {
    for {
        select {
        case <-done:
            return // Exit goroutine when done is closed
        default:
            // Perform work
        }
    }
}()
```

## Q: Why should you close channels in Go?
Always close channels when they are no longer needed to prevent resource leaks and ensure proper synchronization:
```go
close(ch) // Close the channel when done sending data
```

## Q: What are testing patterns in Go?
Adopting correct patterns in testing can enhance the quality and reliability of your code.

## Q: What is the table-driven test pattern in Go?
This pattern is a common approach in Go to run multiple tests using the same function:
```go
type test struct {
    input    int
    expected int
}

tests := []test{
    {1, 2},
    {2, 4},
}

for _, tc := range tests {
    t.Run(fmt.Sprintf("Input: %d", tc.input), func(t *testing.T) {
        got := double(tc.input)
        if got != tc.expected {
            t.Errorf("Expected %d, got %d", tc.expected, got)
        }
    })
}
```

## Q: How do you use dependency injection in Go?
You can inject dependencies through function arguments to enhance testability:
```go
type Repository interface {
    Save(data string)
}

func SaveData(repo Repository, data string) {
    repo.Save(data)
}
```

## Q: What error handling approaches are effective in Go?
Error handling is a fundamental aspect of Go programming.

## Q: How can you create custom error types in Go?
Implement custom error types to provide more context:
```go
type MyError struct {
    Msg string
}

func (e MyError) Error() string {
    return e.Msg
}

func doSomething() error {
    return MyError{"Something went wrong!"}
}
```

## Q: How can errors be wrapped in Go?
Use the fmt.Errorf function to wrap errors with additional context:
```go
func doTask() error {
    if err := taskThatMightFail(); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("doTask failed: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}
```

## Q: How do you handle multiple errors concurrently?
Aggregate errors when running multiple concurrent tasks:
```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup
var mu sync.Mutex
var errors []error

for _, task := range tasks {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(t Task) {
        defer wg.Done()
        if err := t.Execute(); err != nil {
            mu.Lock()
            errors = append(errors, err)
            mu.Unlock()
        }
    }(task)
}
wg.Wait()

if len(errors) > 0 {
    // Handle aggregate errors
}
```

## Q: What are common patterns in Go programming?
Understanding common patterns can help in writing clean, maintainable Go code.

## Q: How does the functional options pattern work?
This pattern allows configurations of struct initialization by passing options:
```go
type Server struct {
    port int
    timeout time.Duration
}

type Option func(*Server)

func WithPort(port int) Option {
    return func(s *Server) {
        s.port = port
    }
}

func WithTimeout(t time.Duration) Option {
    return func(s *Server) {
        s.timeout = t
    }
}

func NewServer(opts ...Option) *Server {
    s := &Server{
        port: 8080, // default port
        timeout: time.Second * 5, // default timeout
    }
    for _, opt := range opts {
        opt(s)
    }
    return s
}
```

## Q: What is the command pattern in Go?
The command pattern encapsulates requests as objects to allow parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations:
```go
type Command interface {
    Execute()
}

type ConcreteCommand struct {
    receiver *Receiver
}

func (c *ConcreteCommand) Execute() {
    c.receiver.Action()
}
```

## Q: How is context and cancellation handled in Go?
Use the context.Context for managing deadlines and cancellation:
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
defer cancel()

// Use ctx in a goroutine
go func(ctx context.Context) {
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Operation timed out")
    case result := <-performLongOperation(ctx):
        fmt.Println("Result:", result)
    }
}(ctx)
```
